1. Introduction 

The Acoustic Emission (AE) detection method has garnered several decades of interest in detecting and studying the life of wood-destroying insects. For over four decades, research has been conducted on detecting the old house borer (Hylotrupes bajulus L.) using Acoustic Emission detection [Kerner et al. 1980, Pallaske 1988, Plinke 1991, Schofield 2011, Krajewski et al. 2012, Brandstetter et al. 2015, Creemers 2015, Bilski et al. 2017, Nowakowska et al. 2017, Krajewski et al. 2020, Krajewski et al. 2024, Krajewski et al. 2024]. This species of beetle is widespread globally [Becker 1949, Becker 1949, Becker 1970], and in Central and Northern Europe, it poses the greatest threat to wooden structural components [Wichmand 1941, Becker 1949, Becker 1949, Krajewski 1995], despite an observed decrease in the number of buildings infested in some regions of Europe in recent times [Dominik 2005].
